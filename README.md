## What is it? 
- Quizzical is a React single-page application (SPA) that receives questions and answers from an API and allows the user to play in different modes.
- Allows the user to choose to receive 5 general questions or a specific number of questions of a certain category. 

## Technologies used: 
- Transferring a **Figma** design to code.
- A react **State management tool**, in this case, is "React Context" to control and pass information across components. 
- React hooks (State, Refs, and more... ) and **custom hooks**. 
- React **router**.
- Methodologies to create clean application architecture such as: "Separation of concerns", "Decoupling", "Encapsulation" and "Mobile first" (for a fully responsive app).
- Version control (Git), to keep track of changes & commits and make testing branches, etc...
